## There are approximately 180 irregular verbs. You don't need to learn all of them because some of these are very rare but many others are very useful and you do need to know them.
大概有180个不规则动词。你不需要学会全部因为很多都不常用。但是有些非常有用你需要掌握。


## What's the easiest way to learn them? Some people think you should learn a list 'by heart'. Others think you should not learn them at all – you will just gradually acquire them over time.
最容易学会它们的方式是什么呢？有人认为你需要列出来背。其他人认为不需要，你逐渐会掌握它们的。


## One useful method is to note down new irregular verbs as you meet them. It is useful to write these verbs (or any vocabulary you want to learn) in sentences and learn those rather than the individual word.
一个很好的方式是记录下来新的不规则动词在你看得见的地方。最好是写在句子里，这样比单独记忆更容易。（也适用于任何你想学的词汇）
