# preface
We recommend that you read the grammar explanation on the first page of the lesson and then do the exercises, thinking all the time about the rules in the grammar explanation. 


Remember that learning grammar is only one part of learning a language. So don't be obsessed by it! Learning examples that will help you when you speak or write is the best way to learn.
