# Present Forms for the Furture
将来时的现在时态


## We use the present continuous to talk about things that we have already arranged to do in the future.
我们使用现在进行时表述我们已经安排去做的未来事情。


* I've got my ticket. I'm leaving on Thursday.
* I'm seeing Julie at 5 and then I'm having dinner with Simon. 
* He's picking me up at the airport. 
* The company is giving everyone a bonus for Christmas.


## In many situations when we talk about future plans we can use either the present continuous or the 'going to' future. However, when we use the present continuous, there is more of a suggestion that an arrangement has already been made.
很多情况我们表述将来计划，我们既可以用一般现在时又可以用going to的将来时。我们使用现在进行时很多迹象是已经安排。


* I'm going to see him./I'm seeing him.
* I'm going to do it./I'm doing it.


## We use the present simple to talk about events in the future which are 'timetabled'. We can also use the present continuous to talk about these.
我们使用一般现在时表述事件在可控的未来。我们也可以使用现在进行时去表述。


* My plane leaves at 6 in the morning.
* The shop opens at 9.30.
* The sun rises a minute earlier tomorrow. 
* My plane is leaving at 8.30.
* The shop is closing at 7.00. 
* The sun is rising at 6.32 tomorrow.
