# Past Continuous


## We use the past continuous to talk about past events which went on for a period of time.
## We use it when we want to emphasize the continuing process of an activity or the period of that activity. (If we just want to talk about the past event as a simple fact, we use the past simple.) 
* While I was driving home, Peter was trying desperately to contact me. 
* Were you expecting any visitors?
* Sorry, were you sleeping?
* I was just making some coffee.
* I was thinking about him last night.
* In the 1990s few people were using mobile phones.


## We often use it to describe a "background action" when something else happened.
* I was walking in the street when I suddenly fell over.
* She was talking to me on the phone and it suddenly went dead.
* They were still waiting for the plane when I spoke to them.
* The company was declining rapidly before he took charge.
* We were just talking about it before you arrived.
* I was making a presentation in front of 500 people when the microphone stopped working.
