# Past Continuous
过去进行时


## We use the past continuous to talk about past events which went on for a period of time.
我们使用过去进行时描述过去的事件在某一个时期


## We use it when we want to emphasize the continuing process of an activity or the period of that activity. (If we just want to talk about the past event as a simple fact, we use the past simple.) 
我们在强调活动过程正在进行或者活动的某个时期时候使用它。（如果我想表述过去事件是一个简单的事实时候，我们使用一般过去时）


* While I was driving home, Peter was trying desperately to contact me. 
* Were you expecting any visitors?
* Sorry, were you sleeping?
* I was just making some coffee.
* I was thinking about him last night.
* In the 1990s few people were using mobile phones.


## We often use it to describe a "background action" when something else happened.
我们通常在描述某个行为作为背景发生其他事情时候使用它


* I was walking in the street when I suddenly fell over.
* She was talking to me on the phone and it suddenly went dead.
* They were still waiting for the plane when I spoke to them.
