# Present Simple or Continuous

## We use the Present Simple 
* for regular actions or events I watch TV most evenings.
* facts The sun rises in the east.
* facts know about the future.
* The plane leaves at 5.00 in the morning.
* thoughts and feelings about the time of speaking I don't understand.


## We use the Present Continuous
* at the time of speaking ('now') I'm watching a movie on TV.
* things which are true at the moment but not always I'm looking for a new job.
* present plans for the future I'm taking my husband to New York for his birthday.


## Look at these sentences:
I usually don't drink coffee but I'm having one this morning because there is nothing else. 
I often drive to work but I'm taking the train this morning because my car is in for repair.
I'm thinking about dying my hair blonde but I don't think my wife will be very happy about it.
My parents live in New York but I'm just visiting.


## Notice how in all these examples we use the present continuous to talk about events which are temporary/limited in time and the present simple to talk about events which are habits/permanent.
